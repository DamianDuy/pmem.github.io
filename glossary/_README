None of the various table of contents tools seemed to do what I wanted,
so I just created my own.  Run ./_Generate to turn all the subdirectories
into glossary entries in index.md.  To add a new item, create a subdir
here with the name, all in lower case, dashes instead of spaces, for the
term you are defining.  In that subdirectory, create the file "_term" with
the name and any alternate terms, like this:

	Persistent Memory | PMem, pmem, PM

I commonly use the above mechanism to expand acronyms, like this:

	PMDK | Persistent Memory Development Kit

Next, in the subdirectory, create the file "_definition" containing the
markdown text you want added to index.md.

The _Generate command will start with _index.template, replace the tokens
%TOC% and %GLOSSARY% with the contents generated from subdirectories,
and write the result to index.md, which should then be checked into the
repo and pushed back to GitHub.  Any other markdown you want in index.md
that isn't part of the generated glossary should be edited in _index.template.

Style note: In the _definition markdown, I typically bold the first use of
the term being described, like **ADR**, but then don't bold the term if I
use it later in that file.  When I use other terms that are explained in
this glossary, I link to their anchors, like [ADR](#adr).

If you hate the way this works, come up with a better way, and submit
a pull request :-)
