When a location of [persistent memory](#persistent-memory) experiences
an uncorrectable error, that data is lost.  Memory on Intel platforms
is accessed as 64-byte cache lines, but there are cases where losing a
single location can cause an application to lose a larger block of data.
This is known as the **blast radius** effect.

As shown in the above diagram, a 64-byte location containing poison
(due to an uncorrectable error, for example), may get its size rounded
up by the device to whatever that device uses as its _ECC block size_.
The Linux operating system can learn about these bad locations via
the [address range scrub](#ars) mechanism.  Linux tracks these areas
using a [bad block](#bad-blocks) tracking data structure in the kernel
that tracks 512-byte blocks, so the size will be rounded up to 512-bytes
by that.  If the application memory maps the file, the OS will map
an invalid page at that location, again rounding the size up to the
larger value of 4096-byte (the page size on Intel systems).
