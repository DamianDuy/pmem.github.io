ACPI defines the notion of a Device Specific Method, often written as **_DSM**,
which allows the pre-boot environment to abstract away some hardware details
and provide a uniform interface for the OS to call.
The standard DSMs for NVDIMMs are
described by the ACPI specification, available on the
[UEFI web site](https://uefi.org/).
In addition, Intel has published the [DSM Interface for Optane](https://pmem.io/documents/IntelOptanePMem_DSM_Interface-V2.0.pdf) (pdf).
