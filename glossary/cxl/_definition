Quoting from the [CXL web site](https://www.computeexpresslink.org/),
Compute Express Link™ (CXL™) is an industry-supported
Cache-Coherent Interconnect for Processors, Memory Expansion and Accelerators.

For [persistent memory](#persistent-memory), CXL offers a new attach point.
The CXL 2.0 specification, published in November 2020, includes the necessary
support for PMem, including changes for management, configuration,
namespace and regions labels, and a flush-on-fail mechanism similar to
[eADR](#eadr) (called GPF for Global Persistent Flush in CXL terminology).

For PMem-aware application programmers, the most important aspect of CXL is
that the [PMem programming model](#programming-model) remains unchanged.
A program written for an NVDIMM-based PMem product will work without
modification on a CXL-based PMem product.

The _2021 PM+CS Summit_ (April 22, 2021) contained this talk which
provides a brief overview of the changes made to CXL in support of PMem.
