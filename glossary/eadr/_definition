**eADR** is the hardware feature that flushes stores from the
CPU caches and memory
controller write pending queues (WPQ) to their destination on power loss.

As shown in the above diagram, there are multiple places a store could
reside on its way to a persistent memory DIMM.  The lower dashed red box
shows the ADR domain -- stores that reach that domain are protected against
power failure by [ADR](#adr),
which flushes the queues in the memory controller, shown
as the trapezoid in the diagram.  All Intel systems supporting persistent
memory require ADR.  The larger red dashed box in the diagram illustrates
an optional platform feature, **eADR**,
where the CPU caches are also flushed.

eADR uses stored energy to perform the flushes after power loss.

The BIOS notifies the OS that CPU caches are considered persistent using
a field in the [NFIT](#nfit) table.  In turn, the OS typically provides
an interface for applications to discover whether they need to use
cache flush instructions like [CLWB](#clwb) or whether they can depend
on the automatic flush on power failure provided by eADR.  Using
[PMDK](#pmdk) will allow an application to check for eADR automatically
and skip cache flush instructions as appropriate.
