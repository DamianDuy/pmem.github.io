[Intel's Optane PMem](#optane) product can be provisioned into
two modes: **App Direct** and [Memory Mode](#memory-mode).  See
[Intel's website](http://intel.com/optane) for product details.
The App Direct mode provides the
[persistent memory programming model](#programming-model).

When configured this way, the OS can provide direct access or [DAX](#dax)
to persistent memory aware applications.  This allows applications to
access the persistence just like memory, with loads and stores.
