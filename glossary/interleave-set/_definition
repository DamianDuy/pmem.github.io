The [Interleaved Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleaved_memory) entry
on Wikipedia describes how interleaving is used for performance, similar to
striping across disks in a storage array.  For [persistent memory](#persistent-memory),
there's another consideration.  Since PMem is persistent, the interleave set must
be constructed the same way each time the PMem is configured by the system, or
else the persistent data will appear garbled to software.

Exactly how PMem interleave sets are created the same way each time is a
product specific detail for [NVDIMMs](#nvdimm).  For persistent memory on
[CXL](#cxl), a standard mechanism for this has been defined: _region labels_.
These labels are stored persistently in a
[label storage area](#label-storage-area),
also defined by the CXL specification.

An interleave set is also called a [region](#region) by Linux, as well as by
the CXL specification.
