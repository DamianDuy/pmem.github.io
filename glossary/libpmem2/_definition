The **libpmem2** library provides low level persistent memory support, and
is a replacement for the original [libpmem](#libpmem) library.
**libpmem2** provides a more universal and platform-agnostic interface.
Developers wishing to roll their own persistent memory algorithms will find
this library useful, but most developers will likely use
[libpmemobj](#libpmemobj) which provides memory allocation and transaction
support.  Higher level libraries like [libpmemobj](#libpmemobj) are implemented
on top of **libpmem2**.
The [PMDK page](https://pmem.io/pmdk/) contains documentation on all
the PMDK libraries, which are open source and available on
[GitHub](https://pmem.io/repoindex).
