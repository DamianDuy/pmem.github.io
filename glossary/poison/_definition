On Intel servers, a special **poison** value is returned when accessing
a memory location that has experienced data loss, such as an uncorrectable
error.  Consuming poison triggers a _machine check_ event, which the kernel
will turn into an exception to the application consuming the poison if
possible (it isn't possible if the poisons is consumed by the kernel itself,
which is can cause a system crash, if the kernel has no way to recover).

For more information about how poison impacts
[persistent memory](#persistent-memory) aware applications,
see the entry on [uncorrectable errors](#uncorrectable-error)
and on the [blast radius](#blast-radius) concept.
