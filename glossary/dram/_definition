**DRAM** is the traditional main memory connected to virtually all
computers today.

[Persistent memory](#persistent-memory) can be
made out of DRAM, which is exactly what the NVDIMM-N products
on the market do.  With NVDIMM-N, the PMem runs at DRAM speeds
because it is actually DRAM, and when power is lost, the NVDIMM-N
saves the data persistently on a NAND flash chip.

[Persistent memory](#persistent-memory) can be
made out of other media types which are not DRAM.  Intel's
[Optane](#optane) PMem uses [3D XPoint](#3d-xpoint) as its
media, for example.

The comparison between NVDIMM-N and Intel's Optane points out
that whether or not a product is considered PMem is more
about the [programming model](#programming-model) it provides,
rather than which media type it uses to implement that model.
