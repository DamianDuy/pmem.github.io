A **poolset** is a [PMDK](#pmdk) concept where multiple files or
[device DAX](#device-dax) devices are combined and used as a single,
logical pool.  Poolsets also support replication that is application
transparent (at least until a failure occurs and administrative
actions are required).

See the
[poolset man page](https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.4/poolset/poolset.5)
for details.
