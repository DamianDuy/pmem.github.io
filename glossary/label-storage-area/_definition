Persistent memory devices, such as [NVDIMMs](#nvdimm), can be carved into
logical partitions known as [namespaces](#namespace).  The
[ACPI specification](https://uefi.org) describes a standard way to
manage namespaces by creating _namespace labels_ and storing them in
a **label storage area** (LSA).

The [CXL specification](#cxl) extends the LSA idea to store both
namespace labels and [region](#region) labels.

Typically the LSA is a fairly small, reserved area, in the tens of kilobytes
in size.  It is persistent and the rules for reading and writing it are
specified in a way that helps detect errors, such as a missing device
in an interleave set.
