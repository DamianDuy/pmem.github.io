**ADR** is the hardware feature that flushes stores from the memory
controller write pending queue (WPQ) to their destination on power loss.
ADR can optionally flush
pending DMA stores from the I/O controller as well.

As shown in the above diagram, there are multiple places a store could
reside on its way to a persistent memory DIMM.  The lower dashed red box
shows the ADR domain -- stores that reach that domain are protected against
power failure by ADR, which flushes the queues in the memory controller, shown
as the trapezoid in the diagram.  All Intel systems supporting persistent
memory require ADR, which means the feature must be supported at the platform
level (including CPU, motherboard, power supply, DIMM, and BIOS).  All
[NVDIMM-N](#nvdimm) products, as well as Intel's [Optane](#optane) PMem,
require systems that support ADR.

ADR uses stored energy to perform the flushes after power loss.  The stored
energy typically comes from capacitors in the power supply, but could be
implemented other ways such as a battery or UPS.

The larger red dashed box in the diagram illustrates an optional feature,
[eADR](#eadr), where the CPU caches are also flushed on power loss.
