A series of workshops about programming with
[persistent memory](#persistent-memory) have been held over the years,
often referred to as **PMem Hackathons**.  Each workshop includes a
series of fully-functional examples, meant to me used as starting points
for PMem programming.  The archive of these workshop examples is
at [pmemhackathon.io](https://pmemhackathon.io),
each named after the date of the workshop.
