The term **Persistence Domain** refers to the portion of the data
path where a store operation is considered persistent by software.
For [ADR](#adr) systems, the persistence domain is the memory controller --
applications can assume a store is persistent once it has been accepted
by the memory sub-system.  For [eADR](#eadr) systems, the persistence
domain is reached when a store reached global visibility.
