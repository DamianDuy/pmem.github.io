The term **DDR** is a generalization of the various versions of
the DDR protocol.  For example, DDR4 is explained
[here on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR4_SDRAM).

When talking about persistent memory, this term is used to talk about
what types of memory are plugged into what types of sockets.  For example,
NVDIMM-N products typically plug into DDR sockets, like normal DRAM.
Intel's Optane PMem plugs into DDR sockets but runs the [DDR-T](#ddrt)
protocol over the DDR electricals.
