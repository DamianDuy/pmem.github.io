In modern usage, the term **NVM** refers to a class of products that do not
lose their contents when power is removed.  Compare this to the modern usage of
the term [persistent memory(#persistent-memory), which adds attribute that it
is load/store accessible.  The general term, NVM, can refer to storage like
SSDs, or PMem.  The more specific term, persistent memory, does not refer to a
product that can only be used as [block storage](#block-storage).
