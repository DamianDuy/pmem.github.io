The JEDEC standards organization defines multiple types of
**NVDIMM** which provide some sort of persistence in the DIMM
form factor.  For [persistent memory](#persistent-memory), the
two types of NVDIMM that can provide the
[PMem programming model](#programming-model) are _NVDIMM-N_ and _NVDIMM-P_.
A third type of PMem in the DIMM form factor is Intel's [Optane PMem](#optane),
which uses the proprietary [DDR-T](#ddr-t) protocol.
