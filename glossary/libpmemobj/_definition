The **libpmemobj** library is the most popular and powerful library in
the [PMDK](#pmdk) collection.
It provides a transactional object store, providing memory allocation,
transactions, and general facilities for persistent memory programming.
Developers new to persistent memory probably want to start with this library.
The [PMDK page](https://pmem.io/pmdk/) contains documentation on all
the PMDK libraries, which are open source and available on
[GitHub](https://pmem.io/repoindex).
