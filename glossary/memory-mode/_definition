[Intel's Optane PMem](#optane) product can be provisioned into
two modes: [App Direct](#app-direct) and **Memory Mode**.  See
[Intel's website](http://intel.com/optane) for product details.
Here we describe enough about **Memory Mode** to provide an overview
of how it pertains to persistent memory in general.

**Memory Mode** combines two tiers of memory, DRAM and PMem,
and it is sometimes referred to as **2LM** or **two-level memory**.

When configured this way, the system DRAM acts as a memory-side cache.
When an access is a cache hit, the data is returned from DRAM (_Near Memory_)
at DRAM performance.  When an access is a cache miss, the data is is fetched
from PMem (_Far Memory_) at PMem performance.  Intel's Memory Mode uses a
64-byte cache line size in the memory side cache.

**Memory Mode** is a volatile use of persistent memory -- there's no
expectation by software that the memory range is persistent and, in fact,
the Optane PMem device cryptographically scrambles the data on each boot
to ensure the expected volatile semantics.

Although this **2LM** configuration is technically possible between any
two tiers of memory, its primary popularity is to provide a high-capacity
system main memory without incurring the cost of DRAM for the entire capacity.
