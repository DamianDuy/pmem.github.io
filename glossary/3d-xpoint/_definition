3D XPoint (pronounced _three dee cross point_) is the media used in
[Intel's Optane](#optane) product line, where the media is organized
into Solid State Disk (SSD) products, and Persistent Memory (PMem)
products.  More details can be found on
[Intel's website](http://intel.com/optane).  There is also a fairly
extensive [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_XPoint) entry
