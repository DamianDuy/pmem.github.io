On Linux systems, the **ndctl** command provides the management of
[NVDIMM](#nvdimm) devices.  This command is vendor-neutral, following
open standards like the NVDIMM details on the ACPI specification.

Some products may also have a vendor-specific command to perform
additional management tasks.  For example, Intel's [Optane PMem](#optane)
is managed using the command `ipmctl`.

See the [ndctl man pages](https://pmem.io/ndctl/) for details.
