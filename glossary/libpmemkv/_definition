The **libpmemkv** library provides
a local/embedded key-value datastore optimized for persistent memory. Rather
than being tied to a single language or backing implementation,
**pmemkv** provides
different options for language bindings and storage engines.
The [PMDK page](https://pmem.io/pmdk/) contains documentation on all
the PMDK libraries, which are open source and available on
[GitHub](https://pmem.io/repoindex).
