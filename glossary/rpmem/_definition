Since PMem is accessible like memory, technologies that work directly with
memory also work with PMem.  RDMA is an exciting example of this, allowing
low-latency, direct access to **remote persistent memory**.

The [PMDK](#pmdk) library [librpma](#librpma) was designed to help applications
use RDMA with [persistent memory](#persistent-memory).

One major application that has published impressive results around RPMEM
is Oracle Exadata, as described in [their blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/exadata/persistent-memory-in-exadata-x8m).
