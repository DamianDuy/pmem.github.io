A **namespace** is a way to partition capacity into logical devices.  It is
a similar concept to the way a SCSI storage array can be
partitioned into SCSI logical units
(LUNs).  The NVM Express specification defines how namespaces work on NVMe
SSDs, and the ACPI specification defines how namespaces work on
[NVDIMMs](#nvdimm).  The NVDIMM version was extended and added to the
[CXL](#cxl) specification in CXL 2.0 so that PMem on CXL can define
namespaces in the same way.

Persistent Memory namespaces are more complex to manage than traditional
storage, since the capacity is often interleaved across devices.  To manage
this, namespaces are defined by storing _namespace labels_ on each device
that contributes to a namespace.  These labels are stored
in a [label storage area](#label-storage-area) on each device.

On Linux, the [ndctl](#ndctl) command provides a product-neutral way to
manage namespaces.  See the [create-namespace](https://pmem.io/ndctl/ndctl-create-namespace.html)
command for more details.
