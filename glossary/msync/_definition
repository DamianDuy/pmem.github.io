One principle of the [PMem programming model](#programming-model)
is that standard file APIs work as expected on PMem files.  For
POSIX systems like Linux, the standard API for memory mapping a file is
[mmap](#mmap) and the standard way to flush
any stores to that range to make them persistent is **msync**.

On Linux, when a PMem file is successfully [DAX](#dax) mapped using the
`MAP_SYNC` flag to mmap, it is also
possible to flush stores directly from user space using flush
instructions like [CLWB](#clwb).  This is typically much faster
than using the system calls for flushing, but both will work.

msync on POSIX systems is roughly equivalent to
[FlushViewOfFile](#flushviewoffile) on Windows.
