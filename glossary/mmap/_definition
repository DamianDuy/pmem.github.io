The POSIX file API includes the ability to memory map
a file using the system call **mmap**.

A memory mapped file appears as a range of virtual memory
in the application's address space, allowing the application
to access it like memory with loads and stores.  For files on
storage, this works because the OS uses [paging](#paging) to
bring the contents of a page into [DRAM](#dram) when the application
accesses that page.  For [persistent memory](#persistent-memory),
a PMem-aware file system allows a memory mapped file to access
the PMem directly, a feature known as [DAX](#dax).

Linux persistent memory support includes a new flag to mmap, `MAP_SYNC`.
A successful DAX mapping with MAP_SYNC means it is safe for applications
to flush their changes to persistence using instructions like [CLWB](#clwb).
Without `MAP_SYNC`, the only way to ensure persistence is to use standard
flushing system calls like [msync](#msync).

The [Linux man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html)
contains the details on how to use this system call.

The equivalent system call on Windows
is [MapViewOfFile](#mapviewoffile).
