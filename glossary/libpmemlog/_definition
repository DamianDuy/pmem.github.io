The **libpmemlog** library
provides a PMem-resident log file. This is useful for programs like databases
that append frequently to a log file.
The [PMDK page](https://pmem.io/pmdk/) contains documentation on all
the PMDK libraries, which are open source and available on
[GitHub](https://pmem.io/repoindex).
