The [SNIA](#snia) NVM Programming Technical Workgroup defined
**persistent memory** in their paper defining the
[PMem programming model](#programming-model):

>storage technology with performance characteristics suitable
>for a load and store programming model

For a device to be considered persistent memory, it must support the
load/store programming model and be fast enough that it is reasonable
for software use it that way.

The full [SNIA NVM Programming Specification](https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/npm) contains more detail on persistent memory semantics.
