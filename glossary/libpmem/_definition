The **libpmem** library provides low level persistent memory support.
Higher level libraries like [libpmemobj](#libpmemobj) were implemented
on top of **libpmem** until the newer [libpmem2](#libpmem2) came along.
The [PMDK page](https://pmem.io/pmdk/) contains documentation on all
the PMDK libraries, which are open source and available on
[GitHub](https://pmem.io/repoindex).
