The **CLWB** instruction is the preferred way to flush
PMem stores to persistence, when required by the platform.
This is the case for platforms that only support [ADR](#adr).
Platforms that support [eADR](#eadr) allow software to skip
the CLWB instructions for better performance.

Unlike the CLFLUSH and [CLFLUSHOPT](#clflushopt) instructions,
CLWB tells the CPU it is desirable to leave the cache line
valid in the CPU cache after writing our any dirty data.  This
provides better performance for the cases where the application
accesses the line again, soon after flushing.

Like [CLFLUSHOPT](#clflushopt), the CLWB instruction does not
contain an implied [fence](#fence), so after flushing a range
using this instruction, it is typical to issue an SFENCE instruction.
