The [ACPI specification](https://uefi.org) defines a table known as
the NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table, or **NFIT**.  This table is used
to report the existence of [persistent memory](#persistent-memory) in
the system.  When the OS detects this table, it typically triggers the
loading of the various modules/drivers that support NVDIMMs.

As the name implies, the NFIT only applies to NVDIMMs.  PMem attached
to [CXL](#cxl) will be found by the OS using the standard PCIe bus
enumeration, just like any PCIe devices.
