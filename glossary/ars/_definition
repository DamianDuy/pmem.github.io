[NVDIMM](#nvdimm) products may provide an interface that allows the
operating system
to discover the known poison locations on the device.
Knowing about these [bad blocks](#bad-blocks)
ahead of time allows applications
to avoid consuming poison, thereby avoiding the associated exception
that typically kills the application.

The ARS interface is exposed as a [DSM](#dsm).
The DSM for Address Range Scrub is
described by the ACPI specification, available on the
[UEFI web site](https://uefi.org/).
