**Optane** is the brand name for Intel's product line using
[3D XPoint](#3d-xpoint) media.  The line includes
Optane SSDs, providing the [block storage](#block-storage) interfaces,
and Optane PMem, providing the [PMem programming model](#programming-model).

As shown in the diagram above, the Optane PMem product supports a volatile
mode, known as [Memory Mode](#memory-mode), which uses [DRAM](#dram) as a
cache in front of the PMem.  Optane PMem also supports a persistent mode,
known as [App Direct](#app-direct), for PMem use cases.

The [PMDK](#pmdk) libraries are design for PMem programming, so their use
with Optane PMem is intended for App Direct mode.
